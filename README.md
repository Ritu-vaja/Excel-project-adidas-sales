# Adidas Sales Dashboard

Welcome to the Adidas Sales Dashboard project! In this project, I have created an interactive sales dashboard using Excel, pivot tables, and charts. The dataset used for this dashboard is sourced from Kaggle and focuses on Adidas sales data.

## Project Overview

### Features
- **Dynamic Filtering:** The dashboard allows users to dynamically update visuals based on selected filters. You can filter data by specific years, regions, products, and more.
- **Pivot Tables:** I started by analyzing the dataset and creating pivot tables to extract relevant information.
- **Visualizations:** The right charts and visuals were carefully chosen to represent key insights and trends in the Adidas sales data.
- **Dashboard Design:** I designed the dashboard from scratch to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
- **Interactive Elements:** The visuals are dynamically linked, providing an interactive experience for exploring the sales data.

### Dashboard Outcomes
The interactive dashboard provides the following key outcomes:
1. **Sales by Region:** Visualize Adidas sales data categorized by different regions.
2. **Sales vs Profit by Retailer:** Explore the relationship between sales and profit, segmented by retailers.
3. **Sales by Method:** Analyze sales data based on the method of purchase, including online, in-store, and outlet sales.
4. **Monthly Sales Trend (2020, 2021):** Track the monthly sales trend for the years 2020 and 2021.
5. **Filter Options:** Use filters for products, years, regions, and more to customize and refine your data exploration.
